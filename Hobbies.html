    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <ol><li><h3>Baking</h3></li>

        <p>Before my year of hobbies, the only dessert I was "famous" for making was a dozen sugar cookies that ended up so hard that they were inedible. Needless to say, I was not a baker. My secret to becoming one? A stand mixer for Christmas and this book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mixer-Bible-Recipes-Your-Stand/dp/0778804666"> The Mixer Bible: Maximizing Your Stand Mixer and Attachments.</a> </p>
        <li><h3>Walking</h3></li>
        <img height="250" src="./images/walking.png" alt="">
        <p>I learned that a day that started with a walk was destined to be a good day. Period. It not only ensured I got time for myself no matter what came after, but more times than not, I'd think of something or meet someone on my walk that would inspire another hobby to try. Setting my alarm 30 minutes earlier to get out of the house for a stroll before work was all it took, and this hobby, more than any other, has become an infinite loop of inspiration for new things to try.</p>
        <li><h3>Taking Pictures</h3></li>

        <p>Snapping photos may have started out as a way to track my adventures, but it became a full-fledged hobby by the end of the year. I fell in love with documenting photo-worthy moments, whether it was a cloud, dirt-covered tulip bulbs, or vegetables on a cutting board. While some photos made it to Instagram, many others are now framed in my home. All this new hobby took was training myself to pay attention: When something made me smile, I took an extra second to take a picture. Before I knew it, I had albums full of personal photography.</p>
        <li><h3>Dating (Myself)</h3></li>

        <p>This one may sound silly, but when I was at a loss for something fun to do for the day, I chose to take myself on a "date" somewhere. It could have been to the grocery store to buy a new magazine or to browse a flea market. Or it could simply have been to the kitchen to look through a cookbook. My dates don't mean spending money, just spending time doing something purely for fun.</p>
